# Astro 497 Lab 2

## Exercise 1:  Exploratory Data Analysis I:  Introduction
- Work through ex1.jl  (a Pluto notebook)

## Exercise 2:  Exploratory Data Analysis II:  Disaggregated data 
- Work through ex2.jl  (a Pluto notebook)

## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Download data from a url
- Read data from a deliminted file into a DataFrame
- Validate that the data was read in correctly
- Describe the basic properties of a dataset
- Make basic plots (histogram, density estimate, scatter plot)
- Peform exploratory data analysis
- Dissaggregate data by a categorical variable
- Recognize the potential impact of missing data and selection effects

Students will strengthen their understanding of the:
- Rate of exoplanet discoveries   
- Observed distributions of exoplanet mass, orbital period and eccentricity
- Relationships between these properties
